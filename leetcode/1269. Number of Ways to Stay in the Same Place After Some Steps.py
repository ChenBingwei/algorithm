# You have a pointer at index 0 in an array of size arrLen. At each step, you can move 1 position to the left,
# 1 position to the right in the array, or stay in the same place (The pointer should not be placed outside the array
# at any time).
# 
# Given two integers steps and arrLen, return the number of ways such that your pointer still at index 0 after
# exactly steps steps. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
# 
#  
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: steps = 3, arrLen = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are 4 differents ways to stay at index 0 after 3 steps.
# Right, Left, Stay
# Stay, Right, Left
# Right, Stay, Left
# Stay, Stay, Stay
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: steps = 2, arrLen = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are 2 differents ways to stay at index 0 after 2 steps
# Right, Left
# Stay, Stay
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: steps = 4, arrLen = 2
# Output: 8
#  
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 1 <= steps <= 500
# 1 <= arrLen <= 106

# 递归改动态规划。有几个可变参数决定你维护的dp数组是几维数组
